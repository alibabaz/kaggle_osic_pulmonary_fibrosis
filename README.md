# kaggle_osic_pulmonary_fibrosis
notebooks exploring kaggles pulmonary fibrosis competion. Data analysis &amp; modeling


1) Will try to do extensive data analysis of the dicoms and CT scans before beginning to model.
2) Run a few models and see if they can bring forth some things to work on and maybe some further insight into the data itself
3) explore different data augmentation techniques
4) More models
5) return to step 2 :)

I have completed some kaggle competitions before, but for both of them I joined with two weeks left 
-- not enough time to thoroughly go through data and iterate in the manner described above

Goal is to finish in the top half of the competition :)
